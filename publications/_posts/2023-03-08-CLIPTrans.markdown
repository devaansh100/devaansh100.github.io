We hypothesise that machine translation can be improved by introducing a visual component. For this, we design a new architecture, CLIPTrans, a combination of the multimodal CLIP and the multilingual mBART. We demonstrate significant improvements over the previous MMT SOTA, especially across low0-resource languages.
