We take a data-centric approach to short-text extreme classification and propose data augmentation methods, LabelMix and Gandalf, which are derived from label-to-label correlations in the training set. We demonstrate their effects on previous architectures and forward the SOTA by imbuing effective inductive biases that were missing in previous models.
