We propose a “Pick-Some-Labels” reduction for multilabel classification - a relaxation of the conventional "Pick-All-Labels" reduction. This is coupled with Supervised Contrastive Learning to develop a framework - UniDEC - to concurrently train a dual encoder and classifier. UniDEC achieves state-of-the-art performance on a single GPU, rivalling baselines which require 8-16 GPUs.
