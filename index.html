            I am a masters student at the University of California, Los Angeles, working on my Master's Thesis on Reasoning with Diffusion Language Models <a href="https://aditya-grover.github.io">Prof. Aditya Grover</a> on diffusion-based language models. Previously, I have worked as a Research Assistant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, with <a href = "http://www.boyangli.org">Prof. Albert Li</a>, working on AI Planning with LLMs. I completed my bachelors from BITS Pilani, India.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did my undergraduate thesis with <a href="http://donglaiw.github.io">Prof. Donglai Wei</a> at Boston College, in collaboration with <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard VCG</a>, where I was working on multimodal learning. I have also been advised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QsqvuGsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Rohit Babbar</a> at Aalto University, working on Extreme Multilabel Classification for retrieval problems.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I am primarily interested in reasoning and how thinking models (like o1) can be trained. Presently, I am exploring Diffusion LLMs and Inference Time Scaling for this task.

            My eventual goal is to develop foundation models and understand how pretraining data affects these capabilities.
