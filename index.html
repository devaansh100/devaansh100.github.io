        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently exploring commonsense reasoning in Large Language Models. Through my research, I aim to get a better understanding of how these models learn at scale and their enhancement through multimodality. Simultaneously, I am also interested in building better computer vision models in a bid to improve the visual components in such systems.
