            I am a research assistant at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore with <a href = "http://www.boyangli.org">Prof. Albert Li</a>, working on AI Planning with (Large) Language Models. I completed my bachelors in Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani, India, and starting Fall 2024, will be pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at UCLA. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I pursued my undergraduate thesis with <a href="http://donglaiw.github.io">Prof. Donglai Wei</a> at Boston College, in collaboration with researchers at <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard VCG</a>, where I was working on multimodal learning. I have also been advised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QsqvuGsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Rohit Babbar</a> at Aalto University, working on Extreme Multilabel Classification for retrieval problems.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I am primarily interested in two streams of research, (i) AI planning and sequential decision making and (ii) retrieval methods for search and recommendation. I find many synergies between these fields, especially with emergent agentic behaviour of large language models. 

            My eventual goal is to develop foundation models for planning - augmenting conventional planning algorithms with language models seems to be a promising direction!
